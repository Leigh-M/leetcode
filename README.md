Production file returns to pass each test on Leetcode website and if appropriate outputs any errors to a txt file

Test folder contains passing tests and console logs results

To run each program, copy the main js file in the test folder (eg: ../leetcode/longest_prefix/test/longest_prefix.js) to your local system, and execute it from a terminal as: node longest_prefix.js it will call the main function and run with a test example

To run all the tests git clone the Leetcode repo and in your local Leetcode folder, NPM install Mocha & Chai if not already installed: npm i -D Mocha Chai
From terminal navigate to a subfolder and run: mocha
It defaults to the test folder within the current subfolder and should run all tests via Mocha/ Chai BDD style
